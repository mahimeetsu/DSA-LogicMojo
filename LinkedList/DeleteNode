You are given the head of a singly linked list and an integer x. Delete the xth node (1-based indexing) from the singly linked list.

Examples:

Input: x = 1,
    
Output: 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 7
Explanation: After deleting the node at the 1st position (1-base indexing), the linked list is as
    
Input: x = 5,
    
Output: 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
Explanation: After deleting the node at 5th position (1-based indexing), the linked list is as
