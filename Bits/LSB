What is LSB:
	LSB means least significant bit is the right most bit in the binary number.
	helps in determine number is even or odd.
	
even:
		n=10
		binary=1010
		LSB is 0
		its even.
		
odd:
		n=7
		binary=0111
		LSB is 1
		its odd.
		
		
check if even or odd:

if(n&1)
	odd
else
	even
	
extracting LSB:

int lsb=n&1;
